# prime.io

just visit my webpage and enter a number (n) you like. My program checks if n is a prime number by chacking if it only has 2 divider. if true -> you will get notified 
that n is a prime num. if not -> it will notify you too. 

It also checks if you entered nothing or just letters and additionally filters numbers from words/letters.
